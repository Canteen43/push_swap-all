Ctrl D to stop providing input from stdin
Otherwise it should keep reading lines.

The checker works now!
	(Although I find it stupid, that it prints error instead of checking if the
	 program prints error).

Split return:
	for empty strings, split an array of strings the only consists
	 the stop character. So I valid pointers to a pointer. The second
	 pointer will be NULL.

Sort-5 has been successfully fixed.

To do:
	Some tests still give KO
		Figure out in eval
	GNL returns many incomplete lines
		try another GNL?
			did not work
		try internet GNL
			works
	SHOULD I REDO GET NEXT LINE?
		debug with gdb?
