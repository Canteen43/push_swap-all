Ctrl D to stop providing input from stdin
Otherwise it should keep reading lines.

The checker works now!
	(Although I find it stupid, that it prints error instead of checking if the
	 program prints error).

Split return:
	for empty strings, split an array of strings the only consists
	 the stop character. So I valid pointers to a pointer. The second
	 pointer will be NULL.

To do:
	Add rule for small numbers
		3 numbers -> 3 moves
			write algorithm for sorting three moves
		5 numbers -> 12 moves
			push minimum: max 2 rotations plus push = 3 moves
			push new minimum: max 2 rotations plus push = 3 moves
			sort 3 = 2 moves
			push back new min and min = 2 moves
			total 10 moves
	Fix get next line part
	Go through eval sheet
