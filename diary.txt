Ctrl D to stop providing input from stdin
Otherwise it should keep reading lines.

The checker works now!
	(Although I find it stupid, that it prints error instead of checking if the
	 program prints error).

Split return:
	for empty strings, split an array of strings the only consists
	 the stop character. So I valid pointers to a pointer. The second
	 pointer will be NULL.

To do:
	There seems to be an issue with my sort five algorithm
		I should never rotate three times, two is sufficient for getting min
		 to the top
		I could check if the thing is sorted inbetween
		I somehow rotated in test 102 even though it was well 
	check the algorithm for big lists
	I get error TLE for testing with 100 and 500
